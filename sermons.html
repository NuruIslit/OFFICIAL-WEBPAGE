                    Proverbs 3:27-28</br>
                    Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due,
                    When it is in the power of your hand to do so.
                    Do not say to your neighbor,
                    “Go, and come back,
                    And tomorrow I will give it,”
                    When you have it with you.
